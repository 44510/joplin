# FAQ

## Do I need Joplin Cloud?

Joplin supports various ways to synchronise data, some of which are free, so Joplin Cloud is not a requirement to use the applications.

Joplin Cloud is a solution developed specifically for Joplin and as such offers various improvements, such as improved synchronisation performances, and additional features such as sharing notes or notebooks.

Moreover, by getting a subscription you are supporting the development of the project. Such support helps in the long term to provide bug and security fixes and add new features.

## What if I exceed the storage space?

If you exceed the storage space, you will not be able to upload new notes. You may however delete notes and attachments so as to free up space. If you are on a Basic plan, you may also upgrade to Pro. If you are on a Pro or Business plan please contact us and let us know that you need more space and we will increase your storage space.

## Do you offer discounts?

We can offer discounts for students, schools and universities, or nonprofit organisations. To get this discount please contact us.
